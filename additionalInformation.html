	<h3>
	Ethics Involved
	</h3>
	<p>
	The California drought may not see drastic to the residents living in major cities and non-rural areas, 
	and that is where the major problem lies. Many residents of these urban areas continue to use 
	and elicit unnecessary amounts of water without realizing the potential side-effects of there actions. 
	This self-first, selfish ideology needs to be fixed in order to cure this problem. Because this 
	is a crisis for every single residents on California, and potentially the rest of the world as well.
	</p>
		
	<h3>
	How Did This Happen?
	</h3>
		
	<p>
	California depends on the winter's snowpack (snow in the mountains) to refurnish the water in the state's 
	rivers, lakes, and resevoirs. But there was a record-low level of snowpack this year (not enough snow left at the end of winter) 
	to supply the water needs of the state. Now, with the circumstances we are in, state legislators, officials, and scientists and engineers 
	around the world are trying to help somehow decrease the impact of this drastic issue.
	</p>

	<h3>
	What the State is Doing?
	</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Reduce Water Use by 25% (compared to the year 2013) for all urban residents in the state. This does not apply to farmers and farm land.</li>
		<li>Fines for cities that do not regulate their residents' water usage.</li>
		<li>Fines for residents of the state that are seen over-using water (too frequent lawn watering, etc.).</li>
	</ul>
